## Overview

Welcome to the Pond Cleaning Bot project repository! This initiative aims to address the challenge of automatically cleaning marine surfaces from floating wastes in ponds. The Pond Cleaning Bot is designed with a net holder to effectively collect and remove debris, contributing to a cleaner aquatic environment.

### Project Motive

Marine pollution poses a significant threat to ecosystems, and this project seeks to provide an innovative solution for cleaning pond surfaces. By automating the process, we aim to contribute to the preservation of aquatic life and the overall health of pond ecosystems.

### Project Features

- **Automated Cleaning:** The Pond Cleaning Bot autonomously navigates pond surfaces, collecting floating debris with its net holder.
- **Efficient Design:** The CAD design, created using Fusion 360, ensures optimal functionality and maneuverability.
- **Environmental Impact:** By reducing marine debris, the project aims to positively impact the pond's ecosystem.
